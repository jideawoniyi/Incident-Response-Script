# Incident Response Script

## Overview
This script is designed for comprehensive action and data collection during security incidents. It captures system logs and network traffic, and can be extended to include additional incident response actions.

## Requirements
- Root or appropriate permissions for accessing system logs and capturing network traffic.
- `tcpdump` for network traffic capture.

## Usage
1. Run the script as soon as an incident is detected: `sudo ./incident_response.sh`
2. The script will save system logs and network traffic to specified files.

## Customization
- Extend the script to target specific logs or include more detailed network capture.
- Implement automated response actions as needed.
