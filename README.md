# Incident Response Script

## Overview
This script is designed for immediate action and data collection during security incidents, including gathering system logs and network traffic data.

## Requirements
- Root or appropriate permissions for accessing system logs.
- `tcpdump` for network traffic capture.

## Usage
1. Run the script as soon as an incident is detected: `sudo ./incident_response.sh`
2. System logs and a snapshot of network traffic will be saved.

## Customization
- Modify the script to target specific logs or extend network capture duration.
- Implement automated response actions as needed.
